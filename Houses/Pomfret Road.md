# Description
![[2279-17.jpg]]
A beautifully presented semi-detached home offering two double bedrooms, driveway parking and a garage, as well as a generous landscaped garden. This wonderful property would make the perfect first home for someone and, for those looking for a home that their family to grow into, there is scope for extension, as others have done on the street, subject to planning. Situated in a peaceful, friendly cul-de-sac off Shalmsford Street, the property enjoys a convenient location in the village, within a short walk of the primary school and mainline train station which offers direct trains to London and is one stop from Canterbury West, where you can catch the high-speed train to St. Pancras. The current owners will miss the neighbourly feel of the cul-de-sac dearly.  
  
There is a large driveway to the front, offering off-road parking for multiple vehicles and there is a detached garage, providing useful storage space. A glass sliding door opens into a porch, ideal for storing pushchairs and muddy shoes after a walk through the fields just over the road (great for dog walkers!). An internal door then opens into an entrance hall which is decorated in pretty, botanical print wallpaper and a door to the left opens into a lovely, bright lounge/diner which enjoys a double aspect, with plenty of natural light flooding in. This room has been tastefully decorated in neutral, earthy tones which contrasts beautifully with the darker laminate flooring which runs through into the kitchen. There is plenty of space for a large table and chairs and French doors lead out to a conservatory, extending the living space, great for when family and friends come to visit or to use as a playroom. You then have access from the conservatory, out to your garden. The kitchen is beautifully rustic and has a country cottage feel to it, featuring a range of solid wood cabinets and worktops as well as open shelving. With the owner being a baker, a range cooker was a must and there is space for a freestanding fridge/freezer, dishwasher and washing machine.  
  
Upstairs, you will find two generous double bedrooms and a charming bathroom. The bathroom is beautifully done and has a natural feel to it, with wooden panelling around the WC, wash basin and bath and there is a storage cupboard which has a stripped wooden door, adding to the wonderful character of the property. There is a rainfall shower over the bath and a glass bath screen.  
  
OUTSIDE:  
  
You have a glorious, landscaped garden to the rear, which is a generous size, offering plenty of room for children to play and for summer parties and family get-togethers. There is a large patio area with a wooden pergola, which can house a large outdoor dining table as well as other outdoor furniture. The current owners love to cook and entertain and have enjoyed numerous summer evenings with friends and family, in front of the fire pit.  
  
The garden features attractive raised wooden beds, ready for you to fill with your favourite plants and shrubs and it has recently had new fencing all the way round. There is a gate giving you side access back round to the front of the property.  
  
LOCATION:  
  
[[Chartham]] is a lovely village, which is well-connected, offering quick and easy access into both Canterbury and Ashford. The property enjoys an extremely convenient position in the village, within a short walk to the primary school and Firs Nursery. It is an ideal place to bring up a family and has so much to offer adults and children of all ages. There is a warm community spirit, with children's sports clubs, and both the church and village hall offer activities for all the family. There are two fantastic doctor's surgeries, two lovely pubs, convenience stores and Chartham even has its very own vineyard, where you can enjoy a day sampling some delicious local wines and taking a stroll around the vines.  
  
Chartham has a mainline train station, with direct trains to London so is a great area for commuters to base themselves. There is also a regular bus service, with buses into both Canterbury and Ashford. There are plenty of stunning countryside and woodland walks, accessible from your doorstep and wonderful cycling routes. You have a cycle path which runs along the River Stour straight into Canterbury, perfect for a leisurely bike ride on a summer's day.
