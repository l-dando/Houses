# Description
![[2774-1.jpg]]
A very well-presented three-bedroom end terrace home with a large garden, offered to the market with no forward chain. This lovely property has been a cherished family home for many years and has been extremely well cared for, having recently had a new boiler installed. It is neutrally decorated throughout, and accommodation is bright and airy, enjoying plenty of natural light. Situated in a popular residential area on the outskirts of the City Centre, residents will easily be able to walk to [[Canterbury]] West Station, the beautiful Westgate Gardens and the High Street and for families, you have the Canterbury Academy a short walk away, as well as a very good nursery.  
  
The property is set back from the road, with an attractive front garden and a few steps with a handrail leading down. The front door opens into a pleasant entrance hall, where you will find a good amount of storage underneath the stairs. You can either continue straight on and into the kitchen to the rear, or a door to the left takes you into a charming sitting room with an open archway leading through to the dining room. The sitting room features a gas fireplace, which really heats the house up nicely, creating a warm, cosy ambiance, perfect for the upcoming winter evenings. Luxurious grey carpet is laid throughout the majority of the downstairs and there are sliding doors in the dining room, which open to the rear garden. The kitchen is a good size, with plenty of space for two people to cook together and with the dining room next door, there is the potential to knock through to create a kitchen/diner if someone wanted to, subject to building regulations. The kitchen features an integrated Bosch oven with an electric hob, as well as a washing machine and integrated fridge.  
  
Upstairs, you will find two generous double bedrooms, a third single bedroom and a family bathroom. Both double bedrooms benefit from built-in wardrobe space. The family bathroom currently just features a bath, but it would be easy to install a shower over.  
  
OUTSIDE:  
  
The property has a wonderful rear garden, which is a very good size for the area. There is a large patio area, ideal for outdoor lounge and dining furniture and the rest is laid to lawn, with a pathway leading through. There is a section of the garden to the rear, which is partially fenced off. This is perfect for those who have dogs and want to give them their own garden or there is plenty of space to build a separate garden room, for those who work from home or would like a hobby room away from the main house. There is a gate providing side access to the front of the property.  
  
LOCATION:  
  
The property is located in a popular residential area, within walking distance to the West Station and City Centre. It is an area which is popular amongst families due to the close proximity of good primary and secondary schools, with the Canterbury Academy, a popular co-educational secondary school a short walk away. You also have The Canterbury Primary School, St. Peter's Methodist Primary School and an excellent nursery within walking distance. The immediate neighbourhood offers convenient daily necessities: small shops, convenience store and a supermarket are all within walking distance. You can also take a leisurely stroll into Canterbury's vibrant City Centre, where you will find an eclectic mix of shops, restaurants and bars so perfect for those date nights and meeting up with friends. There is also an excellent gym and fitness facilities nearby, including tennis courts and a running track. The stunning Westgate Gardens are a short walk from the property, and the area provides easy access onto the A2 commuter route to London.
